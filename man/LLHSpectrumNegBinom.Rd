\title{Likelihood that \strong{1} observed spectrum was generated from a vector of expected mutation counts.

Returns the sum of the negative binomial likelihoods
that each each element of the
spectrum (i.e., the count for each mutation type e.g. ACT > AAT)
was generated from expected count for that mutation type.}
\usage{
LLHSpectrumNegBinom(spectrum, expected.counts, nbinom.size, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectrum}{An observed spectrum (a numeric vector)}

\item{expected.counts}{A vector of (integer) expected mutation counts, one
expected count for each mutation type. We want to know the
likelihood that this model generated the observed
spectrum, assuming each mutational types generates counts according to
a negative binomial distribution with
the given \code{expected.counts} (argument \code{mu}
to \code{\link[stats]{NegBinomial}}) and dispersion parameter
\code{nbinom.size}.}

\item{nbinom.size}{The dispersion parameter for the negative
binomial distribution; smaller is more dispersed.
See \code{\link[stats]{NegBinomial}}.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE} print messages under some circumstances.}
}
\value{
\code{log(likelihood(spectrum | expected.counts))}
